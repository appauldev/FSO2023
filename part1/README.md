# Part 1: Introduction to React
## Notes
* I have used `pnpm` and `vite` in creating the react projects using the following command:
```bash
pnpm create vite project-name --template react
```
* Additionally, I have also installed `prop-types` to enforce prop validation for my components.
* Kindly use the following command to run the dev server (the terminal must be pointing to the project folder):
```bash
# will open the browser automatically. Press 'r' to restart the server
pnpm dev --open
```
