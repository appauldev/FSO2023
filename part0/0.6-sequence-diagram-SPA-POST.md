Get the value of the new note and re-render the list of notes locally<br>3. Send the new note to the server via an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object

    Note right of browser: payload: { content: string, date: Date }
    Note over server: Process the received POST request
    Note over server: app.post('/new_note_spa', fn()) saves the new note at the server<br>and returns a 201 status upon successful save
    server ->> server: app.post('/new_note', fn())
    server -->>- browser: 201 Created (no page reload/redirection unlike the 'traditional' Notes app before)
    Note over browser: When the XHR object has received the response and the response received is a 201 status,<br>the browser will output to the console the response text received from the server
    browser ->> browser: console.log(responseText)

The sequence diagram (SD) for creating a new note in the Notes SPA takes a different approach in saving the new note to the server. Instead of immediately sending the new note upon clicking the save buttong, the SPA will (1) prevent the default behavior (page reload) of submitting form data, (2) re-render the local list of notes with the new note, and (3) send the new note to the server. While there are better approaches to prevent rendering issues and guarantee data persistence (as indicated by the lesson), the Notes SPA is a good way to show how we can make web apps behave in a "more modern" way.
