# Part 3: Node.js and Express
## Running the development server
The project uses `pnpm` as its package manager. Kindly use the following command to start the development server for Express:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
The folder `frontend-dist` contains the same files found in `part2/phonebook/dist` when `part2/phonebook` is built via `pnpm build`
